Routeformer: Transformer Utilizing Routing Mechanism for Traffic Flow Forecasting
This repository contains the initial implementation of the code for the manuscript "Routeformer: Transformer Utilizing Routing Mechanism for Traffic Flow Forecasting", submitted to Neurocomputing.

The code is based on BasicTS, and datasets (excluding TrafficSH) can also be found there. The TrafficSH dataset is available here.

The code is almost complete, and full codes will be released ASAP.
